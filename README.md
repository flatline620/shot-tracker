i want to use vscode to create a new react application

My code will need to be reactive to both desktop and mobile

i want my first page to show a grid that i can select an existing game or create a new game.  a game will consist of data properties name, data and location.  It should be a json object

i load it and it says Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')

in my data set i ment date, not data

i would like to format as mm/dd/yyyy using moment.js

when i click the select game button, it should load a page that has the name location and date in the header and collect the following information, num of stations, min shots per station, max shots per station and total shots, all as whole numbers.  once all fields are supplied, the user can then click setup shooters button that will then show a component that will start with 0 shooters and have an add shooter button.  Once there is at least one shooter the user can add more shooters up to 4 or start game.  If I click Add Shooter, it should ask for the shooters name.  If I click start game it should show a game scoreboard component that for now can just say Scoreboard

I still need the Add Game button

After new game is added, it should go to the game details page as if i had selected the game from the main screen

when I fill out the stations, min shots, max shots and total shots, that information should be added to the game.  if the data exists when I select the game, the fields should be filled in

From the scoreboard i should be able to go back to the game list

When i create a new game the numStations, minShots, maxShots and totalShots should update the game data to be used later

the new information is getting to the handleUpdateGame, but when I check the value of games after setGames, the values are still the old values

I get a warning The 'game' logical expression could make the dependencies of useEffect Hook (at line 19) change on every render. To fix this, wrap the initialization of 'game' in its own useMemo() Hook

it still is showing the original data

I meant to say the Updated games log added earlier still shows the old data

in handleUpdateGame, it does not see i being equal to index and thus is not updating

is it possible that there is a type mismatch

how can i log the type of i and index

When I add a shooter, that should also get back to the game object and I should have the ability to remove a shooter

When I go to the scoreboard it should have a row for each shooter that shows the following information, shots taken, num hits max score possible

THere should be default data of all 0 to start the scoreboard

THe scoreboard is showing No Data Found

on the scoreboard, each shooter should also have a button that allows me to record their next shots.  the number of shots will vary from each station, default to 4.  On this page I should show all my shots recorded so far and allow me to record a hit or miss which can be tracked simply as true of false  When all shots taken I can press record shots button and go back to the scoreboard with the latest information

in recordshots, i get React Hook "useState" is called conditionally. on line 13 and 14

Instead of the dropdown and Add Shot button can I have a Green Button with a /  for hit and a red button with a O for miss

The buttons should be the same size and larger

For recorded shots lets make that a grid where each line represents a different station and lets use the same green / and red O.  The cells should be the same size, smaller lines can just show empty boxes that are light grey slightly transparent background and do not have to be as big as the buttons

Put each station on a new line and do not reset the station number after every hit or miss

I am getting Line 10:9:  The 'shooter' logical expression could make the dependencies of useEffect Hook (at line 19) change on every render warning

for record shots i should pass in the station number and number of shots to take, we should always start with station 1 not 0, increment by one for the shooter each time they go to record shots and not allow more shots than passed in, for now pass in 4 shots for every station
